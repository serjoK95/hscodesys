Web Application for Trade Goods Classification

A personally developed web solution for classification of trade
goods based on the internationally renowned nomenclatures on cross-border
commodities (Harmonized System Nomenclature and Combined Nomenclature).

A web application built mostly with JS technologies. Can be deployed with 
NPM. The web tool also estimates taxation on commerce goods such as
VAT and Customs Duty for within the borders of the EU. This is established 
with the instantiation and deployment of the ID3 algorithm for decision trees
nodeJS library.
